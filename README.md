# INTERNATIONAL GOLD PRICE ANALYTIC

This research is to predict the international gold price by analyzing consumer demand obtained
from social media as well as financial newsfeed data. We started our analysis by acquiring the
data that would in turn manifest into the international demand. We further cleansed the data and
filtered out only the records that were relevant to our analysis. We performed text mining using a
plethora of statistical tools and techniques to derive certain key sentimental insights about the data
set and further proposed a regression model to ultimately predict the international gold price.


# BUSINESS USE CASES
Investing in the bullion market: Since a century
now, the most common benchmark for the
international gold price has been the London gold
fixing, a twice-daily telephone meeting of
representatives from five bullion-trading firms of
the London bullion market. Gold is traded
continuously throughout the world based on the
intra-day spot price, derived from over-the-counter
gold-trading markets around the world (code
“XAU”). The most traditional way of investing in
gold is by buying bullion gold bars. Gold coins are
a common way of owning gold too. Bullion coins
are priced according to their fine weight, By prior
knowledge of the future gold price, more informed
and calculated investments can be made so as to
ensure larger profits and returns.
Investing in the derivative market: Derivatives,
such as gold forwards, futures and options,
currently trade on various exchanges around the
world. In the US, gold futures are primarily traded
on the New York Commodities Exchange
(COMEX). In India, gold futures are traded on the
National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange
(NCDEX) and Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).
The price of gold bullion is volatile, but unhedged
gold shares and funds are regarded as even higher
risk and even more volatile. The performance of
gold bullion is often compared to stocks due to
their fundamental differences. However, stock
prices are more difficult to forecast since investors
do not publicly announce their purchases thereby
closing opportunities to track demand from social
media. Gold on the other hand is a luxury
commodity and people are more vocal about their
acquisitions. Investing in gold futures and options
in the derivative market becomes a low risk
investment with prior knowledge of the future pricing
trend.
